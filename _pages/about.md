Hi! I am Yun-Rong Du, and you can just call me Alice. I am a senior studying Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. I am <b>a maker, a STEM education promoter, and an undergraduate researcher focusing on IC Design and Robotics.</b> 
As a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Alumni, I have a huge interest in Robotics, resulting in my study of ML-based control algorithms in Robot Learning Lab and my commitment to STEM education for high school students and girls. My interest further extends to IC design with my curiosity about the robot's core-the chip-leading me to delve deeper into Analog and Digital Circuit Design. 
Enthusiastic in making, I engaged in numerous side projects. The passion has also grown into my participation in roles such as the director of Makerspace and the general coordinator of the hardware Hackathon “MakeNTU”.
