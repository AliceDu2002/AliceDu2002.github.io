I was on the hardware team in 2022. I studied protocols and wrote the library for LED control, solved the aberration problem when brightness decays, and improved the transmission speed. I also worked on the production, validation and repair of hardware. <br>
In 2023, I was a dancer, responsible for making and fixing my own outfit and designing the performance. <br>
