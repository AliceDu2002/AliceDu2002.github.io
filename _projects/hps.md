During my participation in the Google Hardware Sprint, where I identified a critical issue: the cost and harm of improper recycling. Propelled by a desire to address this problem, I led my team to collaboratively develop the 'Educational Auto-Recycling Bin.' It not only included efficient garbage classification with image recognition but also featured an interactive website to advocate for proper recycling practices. <br>
We spent a lot of time on the interactive animation. In order to attract people's attention, the action of throwing a garbage turned into a important mission in our story. Depending on your decision, the story would end in different ways. We also cooperated with a NGO so as to deliver the correct concept of recycling in our animation. <br>
