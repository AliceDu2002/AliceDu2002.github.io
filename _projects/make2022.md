We built a smart recycling bin which can classify garbage using the AI model, detect whether it is full and report its status to our website. We used RPi along with Pi camera for image recognition, Infineon Evaluation Board for status display, and an ultrasonic sensor to detect capacity. My job was to design the whole power and signal system. It featured high garbage processing speed and capacity with our special revolving design. <br>
We won Infineon Sponsor Prize in MakeNTU 2022 and was invited to demo in COMPUTEX Taipei. <br>
