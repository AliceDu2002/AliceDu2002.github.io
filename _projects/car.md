In the course Cornerstone EECS Design and Implementation, we built a car that can track and follow the line on the ground with Arduino and IR sensors.  <br>
Later in the final project, we worked on image recognition with OpenCV on RPi and the crawl, allowing it to identify, pick up, and classified objects with different shape and color. Due to COVID, we could only discuss and test via online meetings. <br>
