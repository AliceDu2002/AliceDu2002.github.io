As an instructor in the NTUEE (National Taiwan University Electrical Engineering) Camp, we had to design a project for high school students to inspire student in engineering. Thus, I though of the idea robot pet. The robot dog can follow the people, show different patterns and bark when recognize some specific words. From this project, high school students can learn the basics of hardware system, programming and the concept of machine learning. <br>
