In the first semester, we had weekly paper discussion meetings where we shared our insights and discoveries with others. The papers always inspired me and below are my notes and presentation decks.

I also designed an Operational Transconductance Amplifier according to the professor’s specifications. It is my first time designing the whole circuit to meet the power, DC gain, phase margin, and Gain-Bandwidth constraints.

In the second semester, I focused on implementing and improving the oscillator based on the paper “An On-Chip CMOS Relaxation Oscillator With Voltage Averaging Feedback”. I reproduced the paper’s performance of stability and devoted extra effort to reducing the startup time.
