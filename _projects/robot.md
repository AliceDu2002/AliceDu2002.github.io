I built a bio-inspired dung beetle robot since the dung beetle uses its hind legs to roll and its fore legs to move and can adapt to different landforms. I observed and captured the movements of a dung beetle to get the trajectories for inverse kinematics. <br>

    </div>

I built the whole robot and control system from scratch. I spent lots of time on mechanical design and motors to ensure it could support its weight and move. The robot could successfully roll a basketball.
